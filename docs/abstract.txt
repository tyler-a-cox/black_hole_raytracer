Massive, compact objects such as black holes are well known for the interesting areas of physics
that come about because of them. One such phenomenon is the warping of spacetime due to their
mass. Our team looked to simulate the motion of light around a black hole due to the curvature of
spacetime and to visualize a variety of scenarios such as viewing objects directly behind a black hole and
objects behind the viewer. By integrating a series of simple differential equations defined by General Relativity,
the motion of rays of light were simulated. Once the motion of these rays of light were defined
a simple backwards ray tracer was implemented to color each pixel in the frame according to where the ray of
light landed. Implementing these techniques allowed our team to generate sets of low-resolution images in which we were
able to observe objects directly behind a black hole and directly behind an observer looking at a
black hole. These images closely matched images generated by other computational models and observed
gravitational lensing around galaxies.
